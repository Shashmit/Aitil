Inspiration:
In the current AI-driven landscape, the abundance of tools has led to oversaturation. Recognizing this, I felt the need for a platform that seamlessly incorporates the AI tools used in daily tasks.

What it does:
AITIL is a multifaceted AI system designed to elevate user creativity, effectiveness, and overall development speed by 10x. The platform integrates OpenAI and ReplicateAI models to provide responses to user queries. Whether it's a simple conversational question, image generation, or code snippets, AITIL has it covered.

How we built it:
I developed AITIL using Next.js, Tailwind, and Shadcn. The user interface is not only dynamic but also mobile-friendly, adapting seamlessly to any screen size. The platform is hosted on Render for a stable response, and for an aesthetically pleasing landing page, I incorporated three.js. OpenAI APIs, specifically 3.5 Turbo for conversations and 4.0 for code snippets, power the intelligent responses.
